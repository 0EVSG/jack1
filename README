Welcome to JACK, the Jack Audio Connection Kit.

Please see the website (http://jackit.sf.net/) for more information.

NOTE: If you are using reiserfs or ext3fs or anything except ext2fs
for the directory where JACK puts its temporary files (/tmp by
default), then the JACK team recommends that you do the following:

----------------------------

# mkdir /mnt/ramfs

[edit /etc/fstab and add the following line]
none       /mnt/ramfs      ramfs      defaults  0 0

[add the following command to one of your bootup scripts,
  eg /etc/rc.d/rc.local (redhat) or /etc/conf.d/local.start 
  (gentoo), etc]:

chmod 777 /mnt/ramfs

Then add --with-default-tmpdir=/mnt/ramfs to the JACK configure 
line when you build it.

------------------------------

Failure to do this will lead to extremely poor performance from JACK,
since its normal operation will cause bursts of disk I/O that are
completely unnecessary. This suggestion can also be used by ext2fs
users if they wish.
