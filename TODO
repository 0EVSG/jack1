- whether to default to triangular dithering the at 16bit (swh)

TODO (owner)

- figure out how to have pools of buffers for ports by type (pbd)
- proper handling of client return values in libjack (kaiv)
- passing args to drivers and clients? (pbd)
- getting callbacks and args from dynamically loaded clients? (pbd)
- how do dynamically loaded clients (un)register ports, activate, etc. (pbd)
- pool based malloc for rt client-local mem allocation (pbd)
