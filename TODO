*** TODO - A one file mini-bugzilla for JACK developers             ***
=======================================================================

Version: $Id$

Note to developers! You can update this list directly or alternatively
send a change request to Kai Vehmanen (mailto:k_at_eca.cx).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

TO BE DECIDED (owner)

- dropping the use of CAP_RESOURCE (nando)
- support for on-the-fly sampling rate change
- whether to default to triangular dithering for 16bit output. (swh)

TODO post-1.0

- jack session handling (taybin)
- handle mixed-mode 64bit and 32bit clients (joq)
- TBD

TODO general (owner)

- better scheme for handling machine and system dependencies (joq)
- add explanation of protocol versioning to README.developers (kaiv)
- proper handling of client return values in libjack (kaiv)
- pool based malloc for rt client-local mem allocation (paul, moved back here)

TO THINK ABOUT

- ensure that UST/MSC pairs work for transport API
- whether we want to support varispeed (resampling and/or changing
  the actual rate)
- per-block timestamping against system clock (UST stamps at driver level)
- dynamically increase the total number of ports in the system

CLOSED (date,who,comment)

- don't build static libraries of drivers and ip-clients (2003/10/07,paul)
- API to change buffer size (joq) (2003/10/07)
- added code to enforce the 'bufsize==2^x' rule (taybin) (2003/8/28)
- make sure that process callbacks always have nframes equal to buffersize (2003/08/27,done,kaiv)
- add Paul's graph/subgraph explanation to the design doc (2003/08/27,done,kaiv)
- add support for custom jackd --tmpdir in libjack (2003/05/06,done,jesse)
- capture_client has pthread_mutex_lock() in its process() (2003/05/30,fixed,joq)
- update at least the user-visible copyrights with year 2003 (2003/04/05,done,paul)
- add a sane way handle situations where the unix sockets already 
    exist when jackd is started (2003/04/05,sockets removed on startup,paul)
- figure out how to have pools of buffers for ports by type - (2003/04/05, paul, implicit in new shm/port segment system)
- passing args to drivers and clients? (?,done long ago,paul)
- pool based malloc for rt client-local mem allocation (paul)
- getting callbacks and args from dynamically loaded clients? (2003/02/25, paul, see jack/jack.h)
- how do dynamically loaded clients (un)register ports, activate, etc. (2003/02/25, paul, see example-clients/inprocess.c)
- server<->libjack interface version handshake (2003/02/11, trutkin, done)
- alsa-driver parameter parsing patch (2003/02/25, joq, done)
- jack_deactive called unconditionally in jack_client_close (2003/02/05, kaiv, fixed)
- call time client before all others (2003/01/28, kaiv, another solution)
- finalize discussion on transport API, and implement (2003/08/04, joq)
- whether to hide the transport.h structs from clients (2003/08/04, joq)
- define transport info struct contents (2003/08/13, joq)
- resolve helper thread design question? (2003/08/31, joq)
- get portaudio driver working under Linux (2003/10/29, joq)
