TO BE DECIDED (owner)

- dropping the use of CAP_RESOURCE (nando)
- whether to default to triangular dithering the at 16bit (swh)

- update at least the user-visible copyrights with year 2003 (kaiv)
- capture_client has pthread_mutex_lock() in its process() (pbd)
- server<->libjack interface version handshake (kaiv)
- figure out how to have pools of buffers for ports by type (pbd)
- proper handling of client return values in libjack (kaiv)
- passing args to drivers and clients? (pbd)
- getting callbacks and args from dynamically loaded clients? (pbd)
- how do dynamically loaded clients (un)register ports, activate, etc. (pbd)
- pool based malloc for rt client-local mem allocation (pbd)

TO THINK ABOUT

- multiple port buffer shm segments (i.e. dynamically
         increase the total number of ports in the system) 

CLOSED (date,who,comment)

- jack_deactive called unconditionally in jack_client_close (05.02.2003, kaiv, fixed)
