TODO

* silence ports when they are disconnected from for the last time
* use a VSTTimeInfo-like structure for time info
* call time client before all others
* support frames_since_interrupt()
* fix monitor system to be exactly like audioengine's

figure out how to have pools of buffers for ports by type
figure out how to use the same buffer over and over when possible

passing args to drivers and clients?
getting callbacks and args from dynamically loaded clients?
how do dynamically loaded clients (un)register ports, activate, etc.
pool based malloc for rt client-local mem allocation

TO THINK ABOUT:

multiple port buffer shm segments (i.e. dynamically
         increase the total number of ports in the system)
