TODO

- figure out how to have pools of buffers for ports by type
- proper handling of client return values in libjack
- passing args to drivers and clients?
- getting callbacks and args from dynamically loaded clients?
- how do dynamically loaded clients (un)register ports, activate, etc.
- pool based malloc for rt client-local mem allocation

TO THINK ABOUT:

- multiple port buffer shm segments (i.e. dynamically
         increase the total number of ports in the system)
