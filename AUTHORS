JACK was inspired by and partially designed during discussions on the
Linux Audio Developers mailing list. Particularly significant
contributions to those discussions came from (in alphabetical order):

    Paul Davis
    David Olofson
    Benno Sennoner
    Kai Vehmanen
    
Many other members of LAD contributed ideas to JACK, particularly
Richard Guenther.

Paul Davis was the principal author of the JACK API and of the
implementation contained here.  Andy Wingo and Kai Vehmanen provided
many small patches and documentation.  Fernando Pablo Lopez-Lezcano
contributed the capabilities-based code.  Jeremy Hall, Steve Harris,
and Martin Boer contributed sample clients and utilities.  Jack O'Quin
contributed new transport interfaces, buffer resizing, documentation
and many bug fixes.  Taybin Rutkin helps with patch management and
releases.  Melanie Thielker contributed significantly to JACK's
interaction with aspects of both POSIX and System V APIs.  Stephane
Letz ported JACK to Mac OS X.  Jussi Laako wrote the OSS driver
interface.  Tilman Linneweh ported JACK to FreeBSD.  Johnny Petrantoni
wrote the Mac OS X CoreAudio driver interface.  Rui Nuno Capela
designed and implemented several JACK improvements to go with his
excellent QJackCtl graphical interface for JACK.

Many others have contributed patches and/or test results.
