JACK was inspired by and partially designed during discussions on the
Linux Audio Developers mailing list. Particularly significant
contributions to those discussions came from (in alphabetical order):

    Paul Davis
    David Olofson
    Benno Sennoner
    Kai Vehmanen
    
Many other members of LAD contributed ideas to JACK, particularly
Richard Guenther.

Paul Davis was the principal author of the JACK API and of the sample
implementation contained here. Andy Wingo and Kai Vehmanen provided 
many small patches and documentation. Fernando Pablo Lopez-Lezcano 
contributed the capabilities-based code. Jeremy Hall, Steve Harris, 
and Martin Boer contributed sample clients and utilities. 
Jack O'Quin contributed new transport interfaces and documentation.
Taybin Rutkin helps with patch management and releases.

Many others have contributed patches and/or test results.
