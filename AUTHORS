JACK was inspired by and partially designed during discussions on the
Linux Audio Developers mailing list. Particularly significant
contributions to those discussions came from (in alphabetical order):

    Paul Davis
    David Olofson
    Benno Sennoner
    Kai Vehmanen
    
Many other members of LAD contributed ideas to JACK, particularly
Richard Guenther.

Paul Davis was the principal author of the JACK API and of the sample
implementation contained here. Andy Wingo provided many small patches
Fernando Pablo Lopez-Lezcano contributed the capabilities-based code.
Jeremy Hall, Steve Harris, and Martin Boer contributed sample clients
and utilities.

Many others have contributed patches and/or test results.
