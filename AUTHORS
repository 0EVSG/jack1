JACK was inspired by and partially designed during discussions on the
Linux Audio Developers mailing list. Particularly significant
contributions to those discussions came from (in alphabetical order):

    Paul Davis
    David Olofson
    Benno Sennoner
    Kai Vehmanen

Many other members of LAD contributed ideas to JACK.

Paul Davis was the principal author of the JACK API and of the sample
implementation contained here.
